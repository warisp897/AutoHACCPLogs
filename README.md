This assumes the files are stored in OneDrive. The best way to set this up across multiple devices is to upload the files to teams and directly connect the teams folder to the desktop device's onedrive account. If they are, all that is needed is one folder to hold the complete logs, and another to hold the empty logs. The program will save the complete logs as a pdf, and replace it with a clear log after. Use Power Automate to schedule a run time for this program.
